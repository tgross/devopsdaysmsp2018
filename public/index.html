<p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff thinks America needs &ldquo;a national privacy law&hellip; that probably looks a lot like GDPR.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is going to help our industry&hellip; It&rsquo;s going to set the guardrails around trust, around safety. It&rsquo;s going to provide the ability for the customers to interact with great next generation technologies in a safe way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benioff went on to say that as artificial intelligence is used in customer service, &ldquo;that starts to cross the line on what is trust. And that&rsquo;s where our industry really has to come forward and say we&rsquo;re going to make sure that these technologies are trust-based. And I think the Europeans definitely got that figured out.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>history of professional organizations (ex. AMA, AIA, ASME, bar associations)</li>
<li>government licensing requirements are typically delegated to the professional organizations</li>
<li>professional organizations mostly act to counter information asymmetry rather than create monopoloy power (ref <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w10467.pdf">http://www.nber.org/papers/w10467.pdf</a>), but&hellip;</li>
<li>professional organizations inherently act against the direction we want to take our industry wrt inclusion, ability to bootstrap into the middle class</li>
<li>professional certification w/o regulation or consequences is toothless and worthless (ex. CompTIA or ICS^2 or Project Management Institute)</li>
<li>professional organizations ethical requirements are typically about fair dealing and bare minimum safety guidelines</li>
</ul>


            </section>
          <section>
              

<ul>
<li>an advantage of a professional organization&rsquo;s ethical framework is that it at least gives a shared baseline: right now we&rsquo;re all trying to figure this out for ourselves.</li>
<li>we should hold each other to task</li>
<li>we should also cut each other some slack (e.g. ensure your own mask is secure before helping others)</li>
